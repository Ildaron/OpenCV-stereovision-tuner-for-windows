OpenCV stereovision tuner for windows

1.GUI without calibration process - "GUI_Real_time_without_calibration.py" 
Check number of your cameras
         camera1 = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
         camera2 = cv2.VideoCapture(2)  
       
2. GUI withcalibration process 
Make images from 2 cameras by code - "1.Make_images.py"

In the first need prepare  image with a chessboard for calibration process and put these images in the folders "left" and "rights" - please change the code in the file, write your path for folders

After that run the code - "GUI_Real_time.py"
